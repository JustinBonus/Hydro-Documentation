Storm surge risk
========================

NJ coast
------------
New Jersey (NJ) has about 1792 miles of coastline covering 17 / 21 counties in the state. This accounts to approximately 80% of the state's population and caters to almost $400B in annual economic outputs. The changes in sea level and increase in hurricane activity has significantly increased the coast's exposure to storm surges in the past four decades. :numref:`NJSeaLevel` shows the change in mean sea level in Atlantic city, which is almost 16 inches since 1912 and 6 inches since 1980.

This increase in sea levels not only increases the risk of tidal flooding but also storm-related flooding that occurs during hurricanes and coastal storms. For example, during hurricane Sandy in 2012, the storm tide measured as much as 8.9 feet while the inundation in Monmouth and Middlesex counties were up to 9 feet deep. The surge in 2012 flooded an area of almost 27 square miles greater than in 1880. A recent report by the `Rhodium group <https://rhg.com/research/new-jersey-flooding-hurricanes-costs-climatechange/>`_ estimated the NJ's hurricane flood risk and how it may change through 2050. They employed various techniques including a GeoClaw model to estimate the hurricane-related flood risk as shown in :numref:`NJRisks`
