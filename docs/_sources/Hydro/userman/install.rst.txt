Installation
***************************

All SimCenter applications can be downloaded from the `SimCenter Research Tools <https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/overview/>`_ page. This section walks you through the install process, from downloading the application to testing that it has been installed correctly.

Download HydroUQ
===================
To download the |app|, navigate to the `HydroUQ download page <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.community/SimCenter/Software/HydroUQ>`_ which should resemble :numref:`figDownload`. The download page contains a list of downloadable files and directories.

Install on Windows 10
=========================
On the `HydroUQ download page <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/public/designsafe.storage.community/SimCenter/Software/HydroUQ>`_, click on the file with a name ending with **Windows_Download.zip** to download the |app|. In the pop-up window, click on the **Download** button in the bottom right corner. After the download is completed, extract the zip archive to a location in your filesystem.

We suggest placing the directory in the **C:\\SimCenter** folder. Once here, you can create a shortcut to the application (Hydro_UQ.exe) and move this shortcut to your Desktop. 

Once the installation procedure has been completed, it is a good practice to run some basic checks. Navigate to the location where you placed the application and open it by running the Hydro_UQ.exe executable. You should see the user interface shown in :numref:`figUI-HydroWindows`.

.. note::

   SimCenter apps are code-signed and notarized, but because they are not downloaded from the operating system's app store, they may not be recognized as such. Consequently, depending on your security settings, when you start a SimCenter app for the first time, your operating system may bring up a dialog box indicating it is unsafe. If this dialog should appear, hit the cancel button. Restart the app by right-clicking on it and selecting open.

Install on macOS 10
===================

Install Python 3.8
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Mac comes with Python pre-installed, but the default Python is the outdated version 2.7. Since January 1st, 2020, no new bug reports, fixes, or changes have been made to Python 2, and Python 2 is officially no longer supported. SimCenter tools require Python 3.8.

If you have not yet installed Python, we recommend installing Python 3.8 from |PythonDownload|, using the **macOS 64-bit installer**. The installer will place a python3 executable in your **PATH**.

.. warning::

   The latest version of Python is 3.9.1. Specific Python modules required by SimCenter applications fail under Python 3.9 in the pip install process detailed below. If you already have Python 3.9, we recommend installing a Python 3.8 as well that you will use only for the SimCenter applications.

.. note::
   #. We use the python.org installation over others due to its simplicity of installation.
   #. The current Python installer leaves two script files in the Python directory at the end of the installation. You need to execute both script files to get Python set up correctly to be invoked from the terminal. To run the files, double-click on them. The two files, shown in the image below, are: ``Update Shell Profile.command.sh`` and ``Install CertificateCommand.sh``.

Once Python is installed, you need to extend it by installing a few additional packages. We created a **nheri_simcenter** Python package that automatically installs all other dependencies to facilitate this phase of the installation. Start a Terminal window and type the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

      pip3 install nheri_simcenter --upgrade

.. note::
   You can use the spotlight app (magnifying glass at the top right corner of the Desktop) to start a Terminal window. Start the spotlight app and type in the terminal. The Terminal application should appear as the top hit.

Make sure you see a message that confirms the successful installation of the nheri-simcenter package before proceeding to the next step.

.. note::

   If you forget to invoke the ``UpdateShellProfile.command.sh`` script at the end of the install, you can always edit the correct shell file later to update the ``PATH`` variable to point to the Python application.

   On Linux systems, the shell is the program that takes commands from the keyboard that you enter in the terminal window and passes them to the operating system to perform by invoking applications and passing data between applications. It was the only interface available to the user in the good old days, i.e., there was no such thing as Finder! Several shell programs can be installed and made available to you. The most popular is the **bash** shell. The up-and-coming one is the **Z** shell. Power MacOS users will write shell scripts to do many useful things. By default, the applications that the shell program will invoke are limited to applications in a few specific directories defined in the users ``PATH``. Users can modify this path by editing files that the shell program will read from every time the program is started.

   When the front-end application runs the computations, it runs a back-end application using the shell program. As a consequence, the shell program must be made aware of the locations of some of the external applications. These include **OpenSees**, and **Dakota** that you have installed. Other applications, like **Tcl** provide scripts that you invoke to do it. In short, you have to edit the file appropriate to the shell you are using.

   To find which shell program you are using when you issue commands inside the terminal window, type the following:

   .. code:: bash

      env | grep SHELL

   If the result is ``/bin/bash``, you will need to edit the ``.bashrc`` file or the ``bash_profile`` file. If the result is ``/bin/zsh``, you will need to edit the ``.zshrc`` or ``.zprofile``. Typically, the ``.bash_profile`` or the ``.zprofile`` file is the one to edit as by design these will invoke the ``.bashrc`` or ``.zshrc`` file. If in doubt, look for these files in your home directory and see which other installers have modified them.

Click on the file with a name ending with **Mac_Download.dmg** to download the |app|. In the pop-up window, click on the **Download** button in the bottom right corner. After the download has been completed, open the .dmg file and copy the Hydro-UQ application to a location in your filesystem.

.. note::

   We suggest copying the application to your Desktop. After copying the application, you can move the dmg file to the trash or eject it.

Once the installation procedure has been completed, it is a good practice to run some basic checks. Navigate to the location where you placed the application and open it by running the Hydro_UQ application. You should see the user interface shown in :numref:`figUI-HydroMac`.

Testing 
===========

The installation can be tested by running the test problem, which is provided with the installation.

.. note::

   When the |app| is running, open the File/Preferences and ensure that python3 appears under **External Applications:Python**. If you used older versions of SimCenter tools, this was not the default.
