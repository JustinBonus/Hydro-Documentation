HydroUQ presents an interchangeable modular workflow that brings together two-dimensional shallow-water, three-dimensional CFD, and FEA solvers. Suppose you would like to use other shallow-water or CFD solvers than available in HydroUQ. This can be facilitated using the below templates. At present, users can use alternative CFD solvers, flume set up, and different SW-CFD interfacing techniques.

.. dropdown:: SW / CFD interface

    .. include:: swcfdinter.rst

.. dropdown:: Other CFD solvers

    .. include:: cfdsolvers.rst

.. dropdown:: Wave flume: Digital twin

    .. include:: flumetwin.rst

If you would like to interface HydroUQ with alternative modules, please write to us through the |messageBoard| for more assistance.
