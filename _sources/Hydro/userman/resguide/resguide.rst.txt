HydroUQ presents an interchangeable modular workflow that brings together two-dimensional shallow-water, three-dimensional CFD and FEA solvers. If you would like to use other shallow-water or CFD solvers than available in HydroUQ, this can be facilitated using the below templates. At present, users can use alternative CFD solver, flume set up and different technique for SW-CFD interfacing.
